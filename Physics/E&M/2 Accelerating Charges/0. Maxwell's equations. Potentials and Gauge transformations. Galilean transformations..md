## Maxwell's Equations

E&M was summarized using Maxwell's equations which fully describe how E&M fields work. They boil down to the following
1. Gauss Law: $\vec \nabla \cdot \vec E = \rho / \epsilon_0$
2. Faraday's Law: $\vec \nabla \times \vec E = - \partial_t B$
3. No name: $\vec \nabla \cdot \vec B = 0$
4. Ampere-Maxwell: $\vec \nabla \times \vec B = \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \partial_t \vec E + \mu_0 \vec J$

These are all the differential form of these equations but there are integral forms which you can [find here on the Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations#Formulation_in_SI_units_convention)

In these equations there are two constants
1. Permittivity ($\epsilon_0$): This conceptually indicates how well a charge makes an electric field
2. Permeability ($\mu_0$): This conceptually indicates how well a current loop makes a magnetic field

There is also the Lorentz force law
$\partial_t \vec p = q (\vec E + \vec v \times \vec B)$
Which describes the equations of motion for a charged particle under some E&M fields
