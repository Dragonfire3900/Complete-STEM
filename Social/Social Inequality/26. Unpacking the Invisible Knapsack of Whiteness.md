## Summary
---
- This piece explicitly writes down some of the benefits of being white in America. A total of 26 different benefits.
	- These benefits are categorized into either explicit or invisible benefits
	- They are also categorized as either asserting dominance over another group or direct benefits to other people
	- It’s the asserting dominance benefits that aren’t thought about as much
- A major portion of this piece is how white people aren’t taught to acknowledge the benefits which they gain while making an analogy of how this behavior is similar to the benefits of masculinity
- Throughout the piece the author asks the reader to directly question “What can I do to end it” as by their account most people acknowledge that it’s bad but don’t do anything about this oppression
- While reading this piece I mainly thought about the “Who Am I” piece from earlier in the semester as I think it has related concepts.
	- The “Who Am I” piece establishes that identity is a social object with internal and external portions
	- However, when I’ve been taught to think of my identity I’ve specifically neglected the thoughts of others and instead focused on myself
	- I wonder if this is a deliberate way to keep my identity protected from the negative influences my privilege has. An attempt to resolve the contradiction so to speak
	- Specifically because white people do not have to think about their race influencing their identity they do not have to acknowledge their role in systems of injustice
	- How can I actively dismantle the systems around me to make them better?
- I like this piece :)
