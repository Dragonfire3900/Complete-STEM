## Summary
---
- Effectively by believing in “pulling you up by your bootstraps” minority children will be at a larger risk of risky behavior
- Based on a study from Arizona and I would be really interested to see a similar study done in different states to see the consequences
- Thought that this effect is psychological in nature as children act out stereotypes applied to them
