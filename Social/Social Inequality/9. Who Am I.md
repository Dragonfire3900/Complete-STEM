## Summary
---
- Identities are multifaceted and depend on how other people perceive us. They arenâ€™t an isolated object that we have complete control over much to my frustration
- We see things through our own lenses instead of how they truely are
- Race and ethnicity are different things and indicate how someone is thinking about their identity within the group
