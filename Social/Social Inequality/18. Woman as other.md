## Summary
---
- This piece talks about how women have been deemed as an “Other” in the sense of us vs. them. Through this they have been objectified and aren’t able to define themselves without relationship to men
- In particular that constant need of some relationship to men effectively cuts off the ability to exist outside of the definitions applied to her. It’s wrong
- There was one section talking about how men change their tunes when women start to become above them in some way. Before they would provide aid but only up until a point of equality. I think I’ve done that before to an ex-friend. It’s complicated because of other factors (mental health, other people involved) but I think I understand a bit of her perspective a bit more now.
