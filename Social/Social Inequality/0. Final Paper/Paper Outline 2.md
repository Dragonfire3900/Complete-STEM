## What are illusions of choice?

1.  Multiple definitions / instances
	1.  Generally they are a situation in which the choices given are being misrepresented in some way
2.  One choice that’s presented as many
	1.  A choice that requires not being in a specific situation
3.  Each of these illusions of choice come up in some form in social inequality
4.  Why this particular method?
5. [[17. Oppression]]
6. [[5. Systems of Power and Inequality]]
7. [[9. Who Am I]]
8. [[1. The Allegory of the Cave]]

## General Dilemmas
- - -
There isn't a good option available

Main idea: 

## Hobson’s Choices
- - -
One option being stated as two options

Main idea: One choice is presented as two. To people not in the situation they see multiple options but to those in the situation there is only one choice. Modern form acts more like a soft choice / filter rather than an explicit choice.

1. Housing (Clearest progression?)
	1. Main idea: Historical example. Can technically move anywhere but can't get the money to do so. Lawful but limits it practically. Talk about how this is now more of a filter to establish the history
	2.  Black People: Banning -> Redlining -> Over policing and Criminalization
	3. [[8. Racial Domination, Racial Progress]]
	4. [[17. Oppression]]
	5. [[5. Systems of Power and Inequality]] 
2. The Male Gaze
	8. Main idea: It's difficult to make media that does not appeal to the male gaze. You do techni
	9.  Producing media at large mostly needs to have this
	10. [[19. The Male Gaze]]
	11. [[20. The Invention of Heterosexuality]]
3.  Professionalism with Women
	1. Main idea: 
	2.  Forced into specific fields (Nursing, non-stem, etc.)
	3.  Unsure on source material
	4.  Nearly required to get sponsorship from mentors
	5.  This is difficult due to good old boys
	6. [[6. The Meritocracy Myth]]
	7. [[18. Woman as other]]
4. Education
	1. 

## Catch 22
- - -
You can only escape the situation by not being in the situation

Main Idea: 

1.  Criminalization
	1. Main Idea: 
	2. [[29. New Jim Crow|New Jim Crow]]
	3. [[6. The Meritocracy Myth]]
3.  It’s expensive to be poor
	1. Main Idea: 
	2.  [[30. Saving Capitalism|Saving Capitalism]]
	3. [[31. Automating Inequality]]
	4. [[6. The Meritocracy Myth]]
5.  Homelessness
	1. Main Idea: 
	2. [[25. Dying of Whiteness]]
	3. [[31. Automating Inequality]]
	4. [[6. The Meritocracy Myth]]

## Why is understanding these mechanisms important?
- - -

Main Idea: 

1.  Technology is creating another level action limitation
	1.  Mostly talk about [[31. Automating Inequality|Automating Inequality]] and it’s experiments

1.  KS
1.  Families near the MO/KS border used to move to KS when their kids began middle school b/c of the good rep (194/195)
2.  After integration in Kansas City, the state of Kansas became a haven for white flight (from MO) to avoid having their MO children having to go to school in an underfunded, poor district. Up to the mid ‘00s, reading and math skills in 4th graders were above the national average, low hs drop out rates
3.  Gov Brownback started to introduce the idea of removing as much government from people’s lives as possible; cited basically trickle-down economics to support tax cuts for rich people and corporations when he was elected in 2011. This made the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 put forth by trumpet feel somewhat familiar (lowered business tax rates, permanent tax cuts to richest, other bad shit) (199-201)
4.  To make up for these lowered taxes, welfare requirements became more stringent; 2000 gov jobs were eliminated; Medicaid expansion under ACA was vetoed
5.  2012 Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117 reduced income tax on the top bracket from 6.45% to 3.9%; also eliminated income tax for over 200000 landowners and businesses (201). Argument was ‘stimulus for flourishing’, would catalyze 25000 jobs created per year, lower unemployment, and increase development
6.  HB2506: tax breaks for corporations that donate to private school scholarship funds, allowed pub schools to hired unliscend for math and science, cut support for at-risk students, and make it easier for schools to fire inexperienced teachers (this is pretty much word-for-word; you’ll have to change the wording). There was a simultaneous cut to property taxes. This was presented as a win for students, parents, and property taxpayers (201)
7.  Well, well, well, if it isn’t girlbossing too close to the sun! Turns out that public infrastructure like roads, bridges, and traffic lights are largely funded by state taxes, and rich people with new tax breaks weren’t lining up to fund state infrastructure. KS fell behind on public transit, public housing, police/fire protection: C- grade on the American Society of Civil Engineers infrastructure report card; with bridges being graded at D+ and dams at D- (230 classified as high hazard). Cited ‘funding gaps’ for this decline (202)
8.  By june 2014, the state treasury fell nearly $300 mil short of its projected tax collections. More people declared themselves as businesses, and large corporations declared themselves as hundreds of small businesses to get around paying taxes. Budget deficit of $280 mil in 2017
9.  Unintended effect of municipalities raising their local sales tax to offset cuts in state funding. The benefits only seemed to apply to the super wealthy, not the lower and middle income classes this idea originally appealed to. In Topeka, the poorest 40% actually had a net average increase (207). In the 2 years after the tax cuts, only 29,000 new non-farm jobs were created. In fact, KS lost jobs in 2015 and ranked 46th for private sector job growth in 2016. People hated Brownback. (203-204)
10.  Brownback originally ran iun 2010 as pro-education, pledging that 65% of education budget would directly go to the teachers and students. However, the tax cuts dewcreased the education budget by $200 mill, the largest edu decrease in KS history. Base State Aid Per Pupil (BSAPP) decreased from $4400 to $3800 despite the increasing enrollment and health insurance costs in many districts. Larger classes, more kindergarten fees, getting rid of arts programs, layoffs - this also affected the state colleges and universities.
11.  In 2015, the education funding formula was replaced by 2 years of block grants. Midyear budget cuts for education, and schools were pushed to shorten their school years and cut more educational programs. HS graduation rates were rising at a rate lower than the national average, and 4th/8th grade math and science skills declined to the extent that ‘KS could expect further declines in national achievement if corrective action is not taken’. Email: replacing the ‘equalization payments’ ensured that ‘our educational system is not being held hostage by a formula that punishes school districts for things that are out of their control, including changing demographics’. (214)
12.  Before Brownback, the formula included weights to give more funds to schools with more immigrant, poor, and at-risk students to give them an equitable education. Brownback’s block funding encouraged investment in private schools, and the poorer school systems were impacted the hardest. In Dodge City Public Schools, a system where most kids’ first language is not English, extended learning time had to be mostly eliminated. The children were unable to have time they need to learn things and become successful (213).
13.  In 2016, the Supreme Court got involved. Ruled that the KS state legislation had not abided by the constitutional duty to equitably finance public schools (205-206)
14.  KS Supreme Court ruled that the state failed to adequately fund public schools by hundreds of millions per year, and these revised formulas disproportionately harmed poor, minority, and immigrant children. Court ruled that the state system failed to prepare over 25% of the students for basic reading and math skills. Of course, this was for ⅓ of Latino students and ½ Black students (more than the 25% of overall students) (214).
15.  Nearly 70% of KS lawmakers or spouses owned a business or property that got them out of having to pay no state tax on business income. In fact, Brownback and his wife owned for-profit farmlands and shares in investment portfolio companies which managed super wealthy accounts in KS (214).
16.  Tax cuts disproportionately benefit rich white males which harms everyone else in society. People on welfare, single moms receiving child support, and undocumented immigrants are some groups who are harmed. Cuts to social programs actually harm many working-class white people, and it is perplexing why they continue to support GOP tax cuts (which cut their social programs). Read the paragraph on page 211 on the woman protesting undocumented immigrants outrsde an Obama event who didn’t havbe health care and was ‘so concentrated on the illegals’ that she couldn’t think about supporting Obama to get healthcare. Facepalm.
17.  Kansas Center for Economic Growth report in 2016 titled ‘Kansas’ Tax Plan Makes Racial Economic Disparities Worse’. Shows that the 2012 tax cuts increased taxes on KS citizens earning below $42k per year by hiking sales tax and eliminating tax credits for low income families. Disproportionately affected minority communities: 75% of Black households and 83% of Latino households. However, white households are 2 to 3 times more prevalent in the highest bracket compared to Latino and Black households, meaning they benefit the most from the tax breaks. This is more than just the anecdotal evidence earlier. (212)

1. Class (71-77)
	2. Class system is marked by striking differences in income (71)
	3. Which men make more than which women? Asian and white women have higher median incomes than Black and Latino men for instance. However, within each racial division, men do make more than women. (71-72)
	3.  Important to differentiate individual median income versus household median income: can be multiple people with multiple jobs in this statistic (71)
	4.  White people are most likely to have multiple jobs; however, Black and Latino people are most likely to hold multiple jobs so that they can meet basic household expenses. Across the board, everyone’s hours have increased since the ‘80s, but especially in women and those in lower socioeconomic classes. (72-73)
	5.  Wealth has a ‘cumulative advantage’: pay for your kids’ colleges, emergency funds, investing, paying off debt, and giving assets to the next generation (73)
	6.  Shapiro and Oliver found that in Black and white Americans at the same income and educational levels and occupational assets had an average difference of financial assets of over $43k per year (white people had more) (74)
	7.  Aggregate data shows Asians as the stereotype ‘model minority’ with the median household income being higher than white median household income. However, 10% of Asian households live in poverty  - especially recent immigrants - while 8% of white households live in poverty (cautions against unnuanced aggregate data) (74)
	8.  Poverty root cause lies in poor wealth & capital distribution coupled with low wages and high unemployment amongst certain groups whose social location is the result of gender, race, and class stratification (feeds into itself). The solution isn’t just for women in poverty to get a husband and a job. 8% of full-time workers are still in poverty. (75)
	9.  Social class is also a measure of power/ domination. Power: the ability to influence and dominate others. Under capitalism, entities with large wealth are much more able to influence the media and political process in ways less wealthy entities can not (76).
	10.  Skilled, well-paying, manufacturing jobs are being shipped overseas. Shift from manufacturing to service economy in the US. Fewer jobs with bennys and unemployment insurance. (76)
	11.  Growing gap between the haves and the have-nots. Income growth is highest at the top end of the spectrum and stagnant for others. The white high-earners earn more than other races. Homelessness is increasing with this gap. Half are Black, and 39% are children (76-77).
	12.  Class structure supported by the dominant ideology (of the rich) that class is a myth and you get to your position by earning it, when in reality, those who are most privilege don’t understand that there is a system by which those at the bottom are oppressed and more likely to remain by no fault of their own. They are more likely to believe that hard work will make you do well for yourself than poor people (77).
3.  Gender (77-80)
	1.  Rooted in social institutions and results in societal patterns that structure the relationships between women and men and give them different positions of dis/advantage within institutions (change wording). Learned through socialization. Structured at the group level: work, family, mass media, education (77)
	2.  ‘Gendered institution’: now used to define the total patterns of gender relations ‘present in the processes, practices, images, and ideologies, and distribution of power in the various sectors of social life’ (77-78). Analysis of gender based on relations of power rather than interpersonal relations and learned ideologies
	3.  Genders aren’t monolithic because of various intersections: race, class, nationality, sexual orientation. Stereotypes are formed on combinations of race, class, gender, and sexuality. Especially in popular media: the ‘Jewish-American Princess’, the Latina women being either hot or virginal, Black men being over masculine and hypersexual, Black women being promiscuous, bad mothers while nurturing others’ kids, upper-class white women being prudes, lower-class white women being sluts or whores, Latino men being ‘macho’ (78-79).
	4.  Common myth: women have it made. The narrowing gap between women and men’s wages is more likely to men’s wages dropping than women’s wages increasing. Despite the new image of the stereotypical ‘working woman’ in a more male-dominated workplace, many women are still in gender-segregated, low-income, stressful positions without much room for upwards mobility (especially WOC). High violence rates towards women in a wide array of locations signals that society does not values them. (79)
5.  Ethnicity/Migration (80-83)
	1.  Ethnicity: groups which share a common culture, develops within the context of power. Ethnicity’s significance can change over time depending on events. EG: heightened sense of group identities developed by Arab-Americans after 9/11 (80)
	2.  “Despite the ideology of the ‘melting pot’, national identity in the United States has been closely linked to a history of racial privilege”. The term ‘American’ is defaultly interpreted as ‘white’ (82)
	3.  White Americans with various European ethnicities can be modelled as having ‘symbolic ethnicity’, meaning their ethnicity doesn’t influence their lives unless they want it to (82-83).
7.  Sexuality (83-85)
	1.  Everything is connected - employing stereotypes about a Black woman’s sexuality harms Black people and women. Black sexuality has been the vehicle by which racial fears and subordination are driven. It started with controlling Black bodies, both in labor and as sexual objects (83)
	2.  White man/ Black woman was allowed, but not vice versa - as a way to hold up white patriarchy. Stigmatizing Black sexuality is sort of similar to that of the LGBTQ+ community: these systems of oppression operate together to produce social beliefs and actions that oppress Black people in some ways and the LGBTQ+ community in others (84).
	3.  Homophobia also affects heterosexual people as it is part of the gender ideology to distinguish ‘normal’ from ‘deviant’. This can be the root of toxic masculinity. Homophobia is a mechanism to enforce the construction of masculinity (84)
	4.  Sex workers are part of an international system of sex tourism, thus bringing the global perspective to sexuality. Linked to world politics on race and class, given the position of WOC in international sex work. “Exotic” images, etc used to attract rich people to various regions of the world and thus influence migration (85).

## [[9. Who Am I|Who Am I]]

1.  Charles Cooley: ‘the Looking Glass Self”: other people are the mirror in which we see ourselves. A person’s identity depends on how they see themselves, but also on others’ views of them. Our individual identities are in part given to us by others; therefore one is not fully in control of their whole identity (361-362). Others in different locations may reject your identity; for example, a mixed student in this professor’s class identifies as Black, but on her study abroad trip to South Africa, they rejected that identity and said she could only be white or possibly colored (363).
2.  Location can influence someone’s dynamic response when asked who they are. In a study, US-based respondents tended to answer more in attributes (athletic, funny, smart), whereas the Japan-based respondents tended to answer in terms of activities (studying, working). Additionally, the Japanese respondents became more self-critical when they answered in a professor’s office versus when answering alone in the lab. (364-365)
3.  Each identity is unique. It is a joint effort between the individual and the people around them, as well as changing depending on timing and environment. Dynamic, not static. The paper says that even twins who grew up in the same household, interacted with the same people, and experienced many of the same events most likely will not have a complete overlap of identities. (365) These views of ourselves versus others’ views of us can converge or diverge (368).
4.  ‘I don’t think of myself as Black’ or ‘I don’t think of myself as white’: even though the person is trying to make that not influence how society sees them, if that aspect (in this case, race) is important in society, and others associate them with that aspect/category (even if the person tries to separate themself from it), that will still have some impact on that person’s behavior (366).
5.  How a person sees the world depends on their identity, and their identity depends on their experiences of the world (pretty much direct quote). Identities are ‘frames of reference’ and ‘blueprints’ for what someone does and does not do, what they think is good or bad, what matters, what they feel, act, and think. Events that even slightly impact one’s identity can have a much larger effect on a person than anticipated (bc it fucks with the identity) (366).
6.  If a category one belongs to is associated with distribution of power, resources, status, or other social/cultural capital (such as race/ethnicity, religion, class, and gender), that category is important for that person’s identity, whether they know it or not. Race/ethnicity can influence where someone lives and with whom they fraternize (369)
7.  Obama and the American Dream: sure, he proves that being associated with a non-white race didn’t keep him from becoming president. However, in American society, race/ethnicity still does matter and always will until society actually reflects the American Dream. Where race doesn’t give some systemic advantages and others systemic disadvantages. One of the privileges of being white is that white people can choose to ignore their racial identity and can imagine that they are ‘beyond race’. Colorblindness and such (369-370).

## [[18. Woman as other|Woman as other]]

1.  ‘Some years ago a well-known woman writer refused to permit her portrait to appear in a series of photographs especially devoted to women writers; she wished to be counted among the men. But in order to gain this privilege she made use of her husband’s influence! Women who assert that they are men lay claim none the less to masculine consideration and respect.’ Women felt like they had to pose as men in order for their work to get published and listened to, and the author feels thins is hypocritical (?) But it’s either be disingenuous or not have your voice heard because of your gender.
2.  ‘This vicious circle is met with in all analogous circumstances; when an individual (or a group of individuals) is kept in a situation of inferiority, the fact is that he is inferior. But the significance of the verb to be must be rightly understood here; it is in bad faith to give it a static value when it really has the dynamic Hegelian sense of ‘to have become’. Yes, women on the whole are today inferior to men; that is, their situation affords them fewer possibilities.’ Possibly stuff from this paragraph; compares women’s and Blacks’ emancipations but oppressions to keep status quo
