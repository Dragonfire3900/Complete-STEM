# Sections

What are all of the things you would like to talk about with this paper?

Need to initially establish 

## Decision Systems
- - -
What are Decision Systems and where do they show up in our lives? Mainly talking about computerized ones
- Def: Systems which assist in making automatic decisions about something

- Human versions
	- [[6. The Meritocracy Myth|The Meritocracy Myth]]: Good old boys networks and mentorship relationships with women
	- 

- Computerized versions
	- [[31. Automating Inequality|Automating Inequality]]: They show up in all three sections of this book
		- Specifically talk about scientific charity and the able poor

Why do they matter today?
- [[17. Oppression|Oppression]]: They are another layer where oppression and discrimination can occur
- We're seeing how this doesn't just affect the poor

## Interpretability
- - -
These engines need to be interpretable because we need to know why something is happening in order to make sense of it.
- [[31. Automating Inequality|Automating Inequality]]: Refer to the first story of this book
- [[8. Racial Domination, Racial Progress|Racial Domination]]: I think this is where redlining was outlined pretty well so this should serve as an intro to redlining
- [[6. The Meritocracy Myth|The Meritocracy Myth]]: Talk about how denials without reason can be ways of hiding discrimination and biased practices
	- How moving into a neighborhood is still related to redlining (White flight)
- [[17. Oppression|Oppression]]: How systems like this can create barriers
- [[3. The Lottery|The Lottery]]: How without written meaning the importance can be lost with time and just "accepted"

## Accountability
- - -
Someone needs to be responsible for the decisions these engines make and how they make their decisions
- [[31. Automating Inequality|Automating Inequality]]: First story & possibly the second
- [[29. New Jim Crow|New Jim Crow]]: Police Brutality, and War on drugs (?)
	- There are also other articles we looked at in class that aren't tracked so you will be able to use those
- 

## Flexibility
- - - 
These engines need to allow for 
- [[31. Automating Inequality|Automating Inequality]]: Talk about how the solutions were not flexible to address all of the situations
- Talk about identity and how hard it can be to "classify people"
	- [[9. Who Am I|Who Am I]]
	- [[5. Systems of Power and Inequality|Systems of Power and Inequality]]: Talks about how the prevaling systems are social constructions that change with time. You need the system to adapt to those changing definitions

## Feasibility
- - -
There's two kinds of feasibility in this case: economic, and logistical

Economic: How can we make systems like this reasonable to work with within the current economic system?
- [[30. Saving Capitalism|Saving Capitalism]]: How does the market organize itself into figuring out what can and can't be a product?

Logistical: Are rules and properties like this the right direction?
- [[30. Saving Capitalism|Saving Capitalism]]: Is the economy aligned to create more fair systems like this?
	- Most likely not due to how current enforcement is working out
- [[13. The White Working Class and Trump|The White Working Class and Trump]]: Are people willing to move forward with broader and larger policy changes?
	- Most likely not because of rampant belief in [[6. The Meritocracy Myth|The Meritocracy Myth]]
