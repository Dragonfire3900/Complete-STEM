General idea: Should be based on the conclusions and/or thesis of another source instead of your own idea(?)

1. [[26. Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack of Whiteness|Knapsack]]: Could try to see if these 26 different privaleges are unique to whiteness or if they can extend to other areas?
2. [[9. Who Am I|Who Am I]]: Could extend this discussion to the areas of sexuality, gender, and class. Applying the same ideas and seeing what is unique?
3. [[17. Oppression|Oppression]]: Applying this definition of oppression and seeing how well it describes other circumstances and how well it has held up over the years.
4. Before and after Trump?

Generally my ideas are around identity, privaleges, and oppression.
