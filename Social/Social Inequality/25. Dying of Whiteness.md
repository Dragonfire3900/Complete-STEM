## Summary

- This book largely has three different areas that it inspects
	- The affects of guns (and legislation on them) around gun violence (especially suicide) in Missouri
		- It makes a complex point of how guns are not just a simple issue but instead are packed with historical context and meaning behind them
	- The affects of privitized health care in Tenessee
		- Shows how this reduction negatively affects the poor white residents
	- The affects of defunding schooling in Kansas (ran out of space)
