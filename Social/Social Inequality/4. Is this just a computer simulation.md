## Summary
---
- Pondering if we are in a computer simulation and getting the perspective from a variety of scientists
- Mainly looked at how mathematical the universe is and how information theory keeps on popping up in particles physics
	- I’d be interested to see the situation that they were talking about but also information theory popping up makes sense to me
		- Information theory is about how information is stored and transmitted. Interactions are just one way that information is transferred which means that some amount of information has to be exchanged.
		- Makes it feel almost natural to me and shows that it’s the fundamental particle instead of a compound
- Also has a point in that any information which proves that we aren’t in a simulation could in theory be simulated just using an unknown method of computation
	- Kind of disagree with this because we don’t fully understand all of the problem complexity classes
	- That means we can’t really say that everything we experience is simulatable
