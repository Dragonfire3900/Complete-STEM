## Summary
---
- This piece talks about how the nature of the united states is that of an imperialistic capital government which takes resources from others. By looking at the acquisition of the west from Mexico, the decimation of Native American tribes, and various wars around the world this piece establishes that America has always been about a capital empire.
- The title refers to that white supremacy is actually a continuation of that idea. Instead of the land of meritocracy we have inherited a land of exploitation of those below.
- Honestly this is a piece I need to think more about and process more because I can’t really find fault with it
- I wish that the author had gone into more detail about dismantling and changing the nature of the US. Otherwise it’s calling out a problem without offering a solution to it which I’m not sure is useful information. It is a good analysis though that points out something I think it likely true.
