## Summary
---
- This video is talking about how we got to the polarized state we are in today. Connecting it back to the civil war and what slavery was.
- An interesting perspective in this is that poor white people experience a “false strength” so to speak. They have the right to be above other people because it gives them the power to oppress others.
- I think of it like being the lackey of a super villain. You get the right to live in their new world in a slightly higher place than people who resist them. But by agreeing to them you are inherently supporting them.
- I feel like the ideas in this video are increasingly common amongst young people in the “eat the rich” mentality
- However, I wonder what simplifications the author had to make in order to fit this narrative
	- I understand that he’s very likely right but I also feel like his narrative is too simple to be reality. Reality is messy and almost always more complex than the stories say.
	- In order to find that I’d need to understand the history
	- I’m questioning him because I don’t know how well he understands the history and I don’t understand his lens really that well
