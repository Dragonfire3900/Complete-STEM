## Summary
---
- This book tells three different stories of algorithms being misapplied to harmful consequences
	- Welfare eligibility in Indiana
		- Summary: Using a system to determine if a family is eligible for welfare based on publicly available data
			- Intended to confront fraud
			- Didn’t give a specific reason for denial
		- Automatic denials due to missing information that not told to the seeker
		- Lacking of an understanding of context about the person causing people to be denied despite being eligible
		- Had a higher false negative rate than previous system causing many problems
		- Lots of bad communication because no one “owned” the 
		- Stated the idea of “Scientific Charity”
- Homelessness risk prioritization in California
	- Collected information to rank who was at most risk for homelessness
	- People at higher risk were immediately homed in order to solve the problems they were experiencing
	- People at lower risk were likely to have support networks or temporary systems to bring themselves out of poverty
	- Info could also be accessed by the police without any judicial process meaning that it could be used to track down people
	- Policing is starting to be more of finding candidates for crime out of available data instead of investigating a single person
- Child abuse prediction/classification from public data
	- The system doesn’t capture all of the nuance that comes with being a parent
	- Target poor families because they’ve reached out for help with their struggles instead of seeing that as a support system
	- Effectively the model doesn’t really answer the question that the author’s think it does because of the bias in the design
- All three of these circumstances are examples of statistical models becoming corrupted by ignoring the human element to life
	- Through lacking the ability to bend rules
	- Through lacking an understanding of context
	- Through depriving a human element to the decisions that were made
	- Through incorrectly modeling the situation at hand
- If I could summarize this entire book I’d say that the section talking about how information isn’t the essential thing to solving a problem
	- Information just makes decisions easier but doesn’t necessarily solve the problem
	- You need to look at it from something other than an engineering perspective. 
	- YOU NEED A HUMAN NOT A ROBOT
- Overall it concerns me to hear about systems like this because they are cases of taking something that is statistical and misapplying it
	- It’s applying a technique without knowing why
	- Like taking a math proof and applying an identity without proving an assumption of that identity
- Makes me want to have people take more ethics classes when it comes to business and STEM education because maybe that disensentivise systems like these from being created.
