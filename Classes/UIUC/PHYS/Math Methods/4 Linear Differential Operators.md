>[!info] Lagrange's Identity
>This identity describes how the surface terms relate to the integral over the domain for some differential operator and it's adjoint. This also can be enabled by using a weight function to normalize the contribution of the surface
>$$w\left(u^*Lv - v\left[L^\dagger u\right]^*\right) = \frac{d}{dx} Q \left[u, v\right]$$
>$w$ is the weight function and $L$ is the differential operator.
