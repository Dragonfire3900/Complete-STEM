Say we have a matrix $A$. In QM typically there is an expansion of $e^A$ as a series expansion. But let's look at a particular case with the momentum operator 
$$
T(a) = e^{-a\partial_x} =
	1 - a \partial_x + \dots = \psi(x - a)
$$
However this relies on $\psi$ having a Taylor series expansion which converges to the function which might not be true. Instead we can define a function of a matrix using the eigenvalues of the operator $A = \sum_i \varphi_i(x) f$ as a function just of the eigenvalues and not the eigenfunctions.

For example
