>[!info] Equipartition Theorem
>At high enough energy scales the internal energy of a system has the following form/approximation
>$$\huge U = \frac{N_{DOF}}{2} k_B T$$
>Importantly this **does not depend on the specifics of the system** which is why temperature is colloquially referred to a measure of average kinetic energy.
