# Building new quantum hardware for quantum information processing
---
- Angela Kou's Lab
	- The KouBit Lab
- Some applications
	- Algorithmic
	- Communication and cryptography
	- Quantum simulations
		- Use QC to simulate other QM systems
	- Sensing
		- Depends on how well you know the Hamiltonian
- Decoherence mechanisms
	- Coupling to the environment
	- Relaxation: Loosing energy
	- Dephasing: Changing the initial phase over time
		- How the energy changes relative to some env parameter
	- How to deal with this
		- Filter the environment
		- Build something less sensitive to the env
			- Circuit engineering based
			- Both are done
- How to build a better qubit
	- Relaxation
		- Reduce the overlap between two energy states
	- Dephasing
		- Operate the qubit to work at a zero slope for the parameter
		- Using delocalization and super position to get there
- Two main sc qubits
	- Transmon
		- State in the frequency
	- Fluxonium
		- Storing the state in the direction of current flow
	- Fidelity limited by relaxation (1 ms or so)
- Trying to build qubits with more degrees of freedom to reduce both issues

# Climate Dynamics and Data Science Group
---
- Cristian Proistosescu's group
	- Professor in the climate meteorology and such office
- Bio
	- From Romania
	- Background in physics
	- Overall goal is to improve projections of climate change and its impacts
	- Applied field that needs a strong foundation
	- Problem driven
	- THEY HAVE WINDOWS
- The field and tools
	- What's gonna happen in the future
	- Has large amounts of data
		- Correlated data
		- Short timescales
		- Noisy and sparse
	- Strongly coupled multi-scale problem
		- Does not scale well
		- No lab experiments
	- Turbulent & Chaotic systems
	- Most similar to
		- Astrophysics
		- Experiment HEP
	- General Circulation Models (GCM's)
		- A lattice style of system which solves as much physics as possible
			- Digital twin of the earth
		- Primarily written in FORTRAN
			- Started moving towards more modern languages over time
		- Run on FRONTEIR
		- Some processes are resolved (dynamics)
		- Other processes are learned
- Problems in the group
	- Improved Climate Predictions
	- Simplifying down to a quasi-linear model
		- Includes radiation
		- Thermal inertia
	- Using Bayesian model estimation
	- Found a slow eigenmode that could not be resolved
	- Physics of extreme events: Cold spells
		- Think the cold spell in texas
		- Model setup: Stochastic advection
		- How does it change as you change the boundary conditions
	- Climate Sensitivity: Earth's Energy Budget
		- Figure out the equilibrium and the radiative response
		- Pattern identification and warming for particular areas
- Potential problem
	- Wanting to understanding the low-frequency variation
	- Estimating signal from the noise
	- Can you estimate the feedback from the noise
	- Solve a multivariate Langevin Equation
	- Solve for the cross spectrum
	- Fit to the high dimensional observations
