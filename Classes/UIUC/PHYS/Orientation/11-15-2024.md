## Studying novel quantum materials at extreme conditions
---
- Lu Chen's group
- What are quantum materials?
	- Materials that require the analysis of collective motions
		- Has strong correlations using QM
- Three areas
	- Unconventional Superconductors
		- What are the pairing mechanisms for these materials?
	- Quantum Spin Liquids
		- Needs to be experimentally measured
		- How do we identify novel emergent excitations?
	- Topological materials
		- What are the properties of the Fermi surface structures
- Three different measurement techniques
	- Thermal transport
		- Conductivity
		- Thermal Hall conductivity
	- Torque magnetometry
	- Electrical Transport
- Thermal Hall effect
	- A thin sheet which is heated on one sided and a heat sink on the other
	- Measure with temperature probes along the sheet
	- Under a magnetic field that there is a temperature gradient along the "y" direction
	- Around $10^{-3}$ factor between the two
	- Need a cryostat with a high magnetic field ($14 - 17$T)
	- Why?
		- Study different types of excitations which carry heat
		- Metals cause it through a Lorentz force analogue
		- Superconductors have quasiparticles cause this effect
			- "D-wave" quasiparticle
		- Can also study "neutral excitations"
			- Phonons
				- This is weird since they are neutral and do not respond to magnetic fields!
				- Experimentally observed
			- Magnons
				- Spin alignment of materials
			- Majorana Fermions?
				- Unobserved kind of
					- Results has not be replicated
- Torque Differential Magnetometry
	- Usually to find the fermi surface structure they look at the Angle-resolved Photoemission Spectro. (ARPES)
		- Doesn't work for dynamics
	- Uses quantum oscillations instead
	- Uses a quartz tuning fork
		- In a "QPlus" config which glues one leg down
		- The resonance frequency depends on the torque applied to the tuning fork
			- Can depend on what is on the fork tongs
	- Can measure quantum oscillation

## Femtosecond Manipulation of Quantum Materials

- Fahad Mahmood's Group
- Collective Behavior in Quantum materials
	- Correlated materials are hard to understand
	- Tries to describe materials as new "particles"
		- Works to write down effective hamiltonians
	- A lot is in finding these "new particles"
	- Focuses on emergent behavior
	- Many different systems can be described by the same type of energy dispersion
	- Research is focused on
		- Can we detect/control this collective behavior?
		- Collective behavior occurs over very short timescales (a few ps)
		- Over low energies ($1-100$ meV)
	- Ultrafast spectroscopies
		- Using pump-probe setups
		- Excite with a laser
		- Watch how it relaxes
			- Color
			- Electronic band structure
			- Conductivity/susceptibility
			- Crystal structure
			- Local properties (STM)
- Instrumentation techniques
	- Tr-ARPES
		- Ultraviolet photons above the work function of the material
		- See how the emitted electron's energy depends on angle
	- Modifying the behavior
		- Pump energy > bulk gap
			- Add a pump laser to it
			- See how the band structure changes
			- Can look at unoccupied states
		- Pump energy < bulk gap
			- Floquet-Bloch states
			- Bloch's theorem
			- Creates copies of energy using a pump laser
			- Changes the material properties on short times scales
- THz spectroscopy
	- In the THz range since 1 THz ~ 4 meV
