# 4D Simulations of Living Cells
---
Zan Schulten's Group (ZLS)
- Creating a simulation of a cell on a lattice system
	- only assuming reactions and diffusions
	- Rates come from biochemical estimations
- Using lipid metabolic models from UIUC
- Initially didn't have a good idea of how cells divide
	- Introduced a secondary hamiltonian for minimizing the surface area to volume ratio or at least having that information
- There is a lacking in far from equilibrium statistical mechanics and views it as an up and coming field
- Things to read
	- Stochastic Physics in Biology, Reports of Progress in Physics 2018
	- Fundamental behaviors emerge in simulations of a living minimal cell, Cell 2022
